# Machine Vision

This is a placeholder for the Machine Vision project.

## Scope
What kind of images or video streams are being analyzed?

## Tech Stack
OpenCV, PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.

## System Demo
Here is a mockup demonstration of a generic machine vision, effectively illustrating organization's project I worked on.

## Deployment Architecture
The solution is deployed on-premise to avoid issues with internet access shortages, processing data directly at the edge.

S
For long-term storage and model training pipelines, a cloud implementation handles MLOps requirements.
